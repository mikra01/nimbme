# nimbme
Nim bare-metal environment for embedded targets. headless mode

Actual implemented target: raspberry pi1 / pi zero (bcm2835)

General target requirements:
- at least 4KiB ram
- at least 20KiB flash
- 1 UART for terminal
- 1 hardware timer
- [cycle counter]
- software interrupt mechanism

### features
- cooperative scheduler (actual simple round-robin scheme / deadline-scheduler planned)
- code runs under system-mode (armv6)
- async programming model (requirement: do not block the event loop)
- easy portable / most of the stuff is in nim - only a 'few' lines of asm

### project rationale
- bare-metal playground and research
- no vendor specific API's - just Nim
- having fun

### Dependencies
- [GNU-ARM](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads)
- a terminal for uploading files (CoolTerm, yat, realterm or something else)
- usb to serial adapter [!!! 3.3V only on the line !!!] (ftdi, CH340..)

### Remarks
- tested with Nim compiler devel / GNU-ARM toolchain 13.3Rel1 with windows11 host 
- older toolchains will work but not 14.2Rel1 which is actually not investigated
- current baudrate is set to 3000000 / highest one for 250mHz core clock - changeable in envconfig.nim [config_uartBaudRate] 

### Installation (raspberry pi1 or pi zero 1)
- checkout project and compile the demo with "nim build_rp1 project.nims" 
- configure host terminal (EOL is linefeed)
- copy kernel.img to raspberrys sd-card (consecutive builds are uploadable via terminal (Motorola SRecord format used))
- wire gpio14 (TxD0) to adapter's rx-line
- wire gpio15 (RxD0) to adapter's tx-line
- Rx/Tx wires should be short as possible / the ftdi runs fine with 3000000baud (other vendors not tested)
- wire ground (I always use pin39) to adapter ground
- power target on
- follow the instructions on terminal :-)

### whats implemented so far..
- stdio is retargeted to UART
- the demo spawns up to 10 'processes' (at the moment no posix api)
- the complete runtime in cycles (per process) is collected (irq cycles are also collected but at the moment not related to the actual active process)
- total ram is limited to 64kiB / shared-heap around 24kiB but you can change that in the main linker file <hal/<boardname>/<boardname>.ld>
- process stacksize is 1kiB (adjustable in envconfig.nim)
- race conditions are trapped and the cause is printed out to UART (same for uncaught exceptions)
- you can do snapshots of the entire register set (cpsr/spsr not implemented)
- in memory image uploadable (the loader is invoked if a race condition occurs or the demo is finished)
- the ARM is configured to prevent unaligned access

### remark on the build size and experiments
the build size is heavily influenced which libraries and functions you are using. For instance printf and friends occupies whooping >20kiB.
I faced some runtime problems (spurious exceptions) with newlib-nano so it is not used. 
If you experiment keep in mind that the stack needs to be 8byte aligned in most cases. When you face race conditions this could be the culprit (or your stack is corrupted). Experimenting with SBCÂ´s are great because your hardware is not brickable. 
Unfortunately the provided bcm2835 datasheet is everything but no datasheet (seriously). If you look at the PI4/PI5 nothing changed. There are other vendors with superior documentation if you like to start. I simply choosed this target because I recently found one onto my desk and Linux was awful slow (15yrs ago)... and yes I was not aware how 'detailed' the BCM-datasheet is.

### next steps
- GPIO handling helper (RP1)
- more targets (Cortex-M0 planned)
- in memory-app mode for flash targets with ram > 48kiB (compile and run your prototype in ram without flashing)
- generic driver layer
- get ethernet running / usb gadget mode for raspberry pi zero
- sdcard I/O
- signal handling
- spi and i2c examples
- ...
